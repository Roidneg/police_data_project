Police Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on exploring and analyzing police stop data. The analysis includes various aspects of traffic stops, such as the demographics of drivers, stop durations, and outcomes based on violations.
Overview

The project investigates several questions using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The dataset includes details about traffic stops, such as driver gender, race, age, violation type, stop outcomes, and more. The goal is to gain insights into patterns and trends in police stops.
Key Questions Addressed:

    Search Conducts by Gender:
        Examining the distribution of searches conducted during traffic stops for male and female drivers.

    Driver Gender Distribution:
        Creating a visual representation of gender distribution for drivers subjected to searches.

    Mean Stop Duration:
        Calculating the average stop duration by converting string values to numeric representations.

    Age Distribution by Violation:
        Comparing age distributions for different traffic violations using grouping and descriptive statistics.

Features

    Data Cleaning and Transformation: Includes mapping and casting data types for further analysis.
    Visualization: Uses pie charts to visualize data distributions.
    Group Analysis: Summarizes data with descriptive statistics grouped by key attributes like violations.
    Mean Calculations: Converts categorical time data to numerical values for computation.

Technologies Used

    Python: Data analysis and computation.
    Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development environment.
    Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
    Matplotlib: Data visualization.

Installation

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd repository-name

Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Open the Jupyter Notebook:

    jupyter notebook Police_Data_Project.ipynb

    Run the notebook cells to see the analysis and visualizations.

Results
Key Insights:

    Most searches were conducted on male drivers.
    The average stop duration is approximately 12.2 minutes.
    Younger drivers are predominantly stopped for speeding, whereas older drivers are stopped for other violations.

Visualizations:

    Gender distribution pie chart for searched drivers.
    Summary statistics of driver ages by violation type.
